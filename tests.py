# export log should save every match with all infos about kills 
# suicide should happen when player_a killed player_a
# When <world> kills a player, the player looses 1 kill
# <world> isn't a player and should not appear in the players list (players and kills)
# total_kills computes all kills, including the ones caused by <world>
# Game details should show details with total_kills, all players in match, kill per player
